# Arcade Game Project - A _Frogger_ Clone


## Game Instructions

The Arcade Game clone is a little game that is modelled after the well-known
game Frogger. You can steer the player with the arrow keys. The goal of the
game is to reach the water line.

But watch out! Don't let the bugs get you! When you collide with a bug, you have
to start again.
